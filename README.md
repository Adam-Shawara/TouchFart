#TouchFart
A fart app for the new Macbook Pro's Touch Bar. I'm usually the first one to make a fart app when the opportunity presents itself, so why not?

## Features
1. Three different fart sounds
2. Two emoji and one word: "fart"
3. Works with the TouchFart macOS app to allow selection and playback of predefined fart sounds.

## Note
Since the new Macbook isn't available yet, you can test out the Touch Bar's first ever fart app with Xcode 8.1 and macOS Yosemite

## Copyright
Feel free to copy this code and use it to make your own Touch Bar fart app.
